## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS with superpowers

### What I learned

This is a first project in which I had the opportunity to learn basics of Sass.

### Continued development

My goal is to eventually learn Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS frameworks to be used in conjunction with React to build web apps.
